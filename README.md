Camp·us is a platform that connects students to their school's community.

Current features include:
- Secure sign-in and authentication through Google Identity Platform API
- Local data storage through App Engine Sessions
- Sharing posts with text and/or image, which appear on everyone's home page
- High fiving (a.k.a. liking) and commenting on other users' posts
- Buttons on left margin which filter posts by type
- Scrollable box on right margin which shows all users who have logged in
- Navigation bar on top margin with correct name and picture displayed
- Dropdown menu under profile pictures with links to 'Profile', 'About us', and 'Log out'
- Profile page that allows user to edit profile information
- About us page (connect with us on LinkedIn!)

Features we want to implement:
- Increased compatibility with smaller screen (especially mobile devices)
- AJAX script to dynamically update HTML when posting, high fiving, or commenting rather than refreshing the page
- Ability to high five comments
- Facebook sign-in or an independent authentication service
